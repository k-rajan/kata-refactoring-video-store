This source code follows Martin Fowler's book " Refactoring, Improving the Design of Existing Code".

When you find you have to add a feature to a program, and the program's code is not
structured in a convenient way to add the feature, first refactor the program to make it
easy to add the feature, then add the feature.

### starter code
 - Source code is in kotlin, but there are java style P)
 - Good part there is a test which does string comparison ;)


# Usage

- The purpose of this is to provide good examples for the refactoring.
- Apply kotlin in idiomatic kotlin way.
- Use IDE for refactoring. One should not break anything not even compilation, at least IDE in most cases.

# Journal
Any refactoring is about improving the code in a particular objective/direction. 

Journal followings
- The objective/direction and rational behind it.
- Steps followed to reach there, what was trigger, IDE helped.
- Reflect on the change made, benefit, language feature and alternatives.
